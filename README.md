# BJUT-OS-coursework
Implementation of requirements in the so-called 实验指导书. 

## Requirements
Source code can be executed correctly under Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS. Did not test them on any other OS. 

## Attention
The name of these files are terrible, and annotations in a file are as terrible as the name of the file (probably no annotation at all), for this repository is only a backup of my work, and I will never open these file after the course finished. So basically you can help yourself if you need to use the source code.
